# Forman-Ricci Curvature Analysis on Directed Graphs

## Problem Statement

Using the **NetworkX** library in Python, the goal is to construct a directed graph with weighted edges based on a provided image. The analysis involves:

1. Constructing the given graph while ensuring that edges follow the correct unidirectional flow.
2. Computing the **Forman-Ricci curvature** for each edge in the graph.
3. Annotating the computed curvature values on the graph for visualization.

## Output Graphs

## Key Learnings

From this assignment, I have gained the following insights:

- **Graph Construction**: Learned how to instantiate directed graphs in NetworkX and add weighted edges.
- **Graph Visualization**: Understood techniques for making graph presentations more intuitive, including curved edges and node coloring.
- **Forman-Ricci Curvature**: Explored how curvature can be computed for edges in directed graphs and what its values signify.
- **Graph Annotation**: Practiced adding computed values (such as curvature) directly onto graph visualizations.
- **Handling Directed vs. Undirected Edges**: Differentiated between directed and undirected edges, ensuring proper connectivity and curvature computation.

## How to Run

1. Ensure **NetworkX** and **GraphRicciCurvature** are installed.
2. Load the Python script or Jupyter notebook.
3. Execute the script to generate the annotated graph.
