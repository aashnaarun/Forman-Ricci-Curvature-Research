# Forman-Ricci Curvature Analysis on given Graph

## Task Assigned

Using the **NetworkX** library in Python, the goal is to construct the given graph with weighted edges and directions as shown in the graph image. 

My task breakdown is as follows:

1. Constructing the provided graph by ensuring that edges follow the correct flow along with their weights.
2. Computing the **Forman-Ricci curvature** for each edge present in the graph.
3. Annotating the calculated curvature values on the graph for demonstration.

## Learnings from the task

- **Forman-Ricci Curvature**: Explored how curvature can be calculated for edges in various graph types and the significance of its value.
- **Graph Annotation**: Understood the process of adding the weight or the computed values onto graph visualizations and making it presentable.
- **Handling Directed vs. Undirected Edges**: Understood and differentiated between directed and undirected edges, ensuring proper connectivity and curvature computation with the correct use of the formule mentioned from the video.
- **Understanding Curvature**: Explored various formulae that captures curvature and its usage in real world scenarios.
    - **Formulae used**:
